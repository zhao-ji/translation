### Some hints

```
Oxford Advanced Learner's and Longman (LDOCE) are different from Webster’s,
Macmillan, and Collins in that they are targeted at foreign students of English.

LDOCE uses in its definitions a subset of the most frequent words (~2000 most
common English words) which guarantees that students with limited vocabulary are
still able to use it. That is why it is so highly recommended for foreign
students — this is the type of dictionary that must replace the bilingual
dictionaries that students use at the beginner levels.

Macmillan, Collins and Webster dictionaries are typically targeted at native
speakers who already have an extensive vocabulary. The words used in definitions
will often be more complex than the terms they define. Good for college-level
and above. Not recommended for beginner-intermediate students of English.
